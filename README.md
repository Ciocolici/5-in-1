# 5 in 1

A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. The program is made of a menu which contains another 5 programs from which the user is able to choose:

- **Bubblesort**: A simple sorting algorithm.
- **Diamanten**: Create your own diamond.
- **Fibonacci**: In the Fibonacci sequence each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- **Taschenrechner**: Just a basic calculator.
- **Warm und KÃ¤lter**: A number guessing game.

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch `5in1.exe` located in `bin/Debug/net6.0`.*

*Note: German language used.*
